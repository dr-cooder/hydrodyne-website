      <p>With the growth Hydrodyne has been seeing in recent months, it appears that the company has gotten too big for its britches. “The demand of chess pieces has skyrocketed, and our capability to manufacture has stayed the same” Says Miko Bunek the CTO of Hydrodyne “We are still manufacturing in the small warehouse that we bought as a startup, and that has been stuffed to the gills with equipment.”</p>
      <p>Hydrodyne has a commitment to quality and safety in the manufacturing facility, and in order to maintain that a new facility will be opened in San Jose California. This expansion of manufacturing capability is indicative of Hydrodyne's recent growth. The company swelled from around 200 to 400 people last quarter. Miko comments "Things are looking up for the company, I sure hope nothing unexpected happens" </p>
