      <p>A couple of employees at Hydrodyne have accused the company of selectively placing white Caucasians at higher-level positions while having marginalized ethnic groups at lower entry-level positions. There have been a handful of protests, and major news outlets from CNN and FOX showed up outside of Hydrodyne headquarters to see what the CEO has to say and if any steps will be taken to deal with this matter.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that Hydrodyne is a new start up company and it would appear it is going through some of the same turmoils that some startups face concurring work equality. Hydrodyne stock (HYDR) fell 2% today.</p>
      <p>A transcript of an interview with a CNN representative is as follows.</p>
      <div class="interview">
        <p>CNN REP: Joining us now is Dr. Joseph Kollie, CEO of Hydrodyne. Thank you for being here today, Doctor.
        <p>JOSEPH: Thanks for having me.</p>
        <p>CNN REP: Now, Dr. Kollie, I'm sure you are aware of the common criticism of Hydrodyne on its lack of racial diversity in its workplace. How do you, a black man, respond to this criticism?</p>
        <p>JOSEPH: I was distraught that such an issue as racial discrimination and a lack of diversity has become a problem here at Hydrodyne. When the company was founded in the early ages what I noticed was that what made the company so successful was the integration of all people so if any issues such as this arises we must discuss it which is why i'm here.</p>
        <p>CNN REP: Let me rephrase: many are concerned with the distribution of ethnicities amongst positions in the hierarchy of Hydrodyne's workplace. Most engineers and executives are white, and whatever hispanics there are are mostly janitors or low-level technicians. A lot of that criticism is coming from the latter groups of Hydrodyne employees themselves.</p>
        <p>JOSEPH: Yes, I've been told and in fact recently we have hired Dr. Richard as our CFO he too is African American. I'm sure there will be more people of color who are qualified to take on bigger roles. I think the issue here is having more qualified people fill up these senior positions. I've spoken with HR to see how best the company and recruiting team can be unbiased during the hiring process and we've figured out to have more marginalized people be a part of the hiring process, this will make sure there's no skewness of people who are of color and qualified.</p>
        <p>CNN REP: It's true that some people may not be aware of that, but even some of those who do are concerned that this is a performative, token effort.</p>
        <p>JOSEPH: This is not about performative, or token effort, what it is is that most of the people who apply to Hydrodyne are qualified, which is mostly due to graduating and going way beyond and getting their masters or doctoral degree. When you compare this to marginalized people they don't have as much advantage to attend a four year university or the environment in which they come from often has many roadblocks that makes it difficult for them to have a foot in the door. The team and I have brought this issue up and we are doing our best to make sure this is taken into account during the hiring process. I also wish to emphasize this is not a token effort or affirmative action, the team at hydrodyne are in roles that require a lot from them and we can not have the company fall on people who are not qualified. I have increased the staff and made sure that any new hires are fully trained. This is another way of promoting people to take on more senior roles with some readiness.</p>
        <p>CNN REP: Well, here's hoping some progress towards Hydrodyne's diversity goal can be seen in the coming quarters. Thanks again for coming here, Dr. Kollie.</p>
        <p>JOSEPH: Thank you.</p>
