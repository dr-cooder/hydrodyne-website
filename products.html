    <h2>The CHESS Piece</h2>
    <p>Hydrodyne's flagship product is the CHESS piece, which stands for Compact Hydrogen Energy Storage System. There are three CHESS pieces in production currently, the Pawn, The Bishop and the Queen, in order of storage capacity. The CHESS pieces can be filled at the same stations that you would fill your electric vehicle. It stores the hydrogen at ambient temperatures and a pressure of 500 bar, it comes pre pressurized so you get every last drop of energy from the tank. With top of the line, fiberglass storage tanks, you can rest assured that our CHESS pieces are safer than even a lithium Ion battery. You can either buy a chess piece of your own to fill at your own convenience, or you can rent one from a participating gas station if you find yourself stranded.</p>

          <h3>Pawn</h3>
          <p>The smallest of the CHESS pieces. With a capacity of 2 liters, the Pawn has enough juice to take a Toyota Mirai 5 and a half miles to the nearest filling station. This is enough to drive from RIT to downtown rochester. Its formfactor, a simple cylinder, is convenient to throw in a backpack or keep in the trunk of your car.</p>

          <h3>Bishop</h3>
          <p>The bishop has double the capacity of the Pawn, at 4 liters, it has enough capacity to take a Toyota Mirai 11 miles, or enough to get from RIT to the coast of lake ontario. The Bishop contains two tanks side by side in a backpack-like formfactor, with straps so you can carry it on your back.</p>

          <h3>Queen</h3>
          <p>The queen has double the capacity of the Bishop at 8 liters, and has the benefit of having a built-in fuel cell stack, so that you can convert the hydrogen directly to electricity. This can be useful for electric vehicles that don't use hydrogen, or any other electricity need. It has a capacity of five KW/h. This is enough energy to take a Tesla 24 miles, which can take you halfway to Buffalo from rochester. A lithium ion battery of the same capacity would weigh over 100 pounds.</p>
